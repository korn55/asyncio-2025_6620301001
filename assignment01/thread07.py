# The code creates a ThreadPoolExecutor as a context manager, telling it how many
# worker threads it wants in the pool. It then uses .map() to step through an iterable
# of things, in your case range(3), passing each one to a thread in the pool.

# The end of the with block causes the ThreadPoolExecutor to do a .join() on each of
# the threads in the pool. It is strongly recommended that you use ThreadPoolExecutor
# as a context manager when you can so that you never forget to .join() the threads
